x-we are supposed to handle the inside of an object. Does that mean darkness? - yes
x--> at the moment a very dark shade of the color of the surrounding object. Is that enough?

x-scene.hooks and scene.img need to be initiated in a separate function and need to be freed at the end

x-is destroying the window at the end enough? Does it need to be done in steps?
