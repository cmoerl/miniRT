Open Questions:

what do we need to be able to do with the picture once rendered?
-> obviously exit
-> resolution should be changeable?
-> what does rotate and translate objects mean??
-> in subject it says: "Your program must be able to resize the objectâ€™s unique properties: diameter for a
sphere and the width and height for a cylinder."
-> do we need to move the camera, and zoom in and out?

we are supposed to handle the inside of an object. Does that mean darkness?
