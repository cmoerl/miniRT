Open Questions:

what do we need to be able to do with the picture once rendered?
-> obviously exit
-> resolution should be changeable? - only via macro
-> what does rotate and translate objects mean?? !needs research!
-> in subject it says: "Your program must be able to resize the objectâ€™s unique properties: diameter for a
sphere and the width and height for a cylinder." - not meant interactively
-> do we need to move the camera, and zoom in and out? - no

we are supposed to handle the inside of an object. Does that mean darkness? - yes

TODO:

    - Anti-Aliasing Techniques?
